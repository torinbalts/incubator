    In this world, dragons do exist. They are just able to blend themselves within our society. In ancient times, both were able to coexist but as
evolution went on, humans started being afraid of the Dragon Blenders, also known as Din. This race is able to switch from Dragon to human form. They
are smarter and stronger than most humans and in wars, they were valuable assets, but have one down side: Their numbers are hard to increase. One of
the characteristics of the Dins is that from their insemination to actual hatching it takes them 3 years and they are only able to make one at a time
but on the positive side, the mantainence they require is not much since while inside the hatch, the eggs is rock hard and is able to absorb energy to
devolp from his environments but lose that ability after hatching.

    Humans started to become afraid of their power and assassinations on Dins started. The Dins liked humans, for they were capable of love, capable
capable of pursuing their desires with a strong determination; Things the Dins were not capable, for they were aware of the course of life and humans
emotions. With this they decided they would back off and live in the mountains deep, where humans could not reach.

    Centuries later, humans forgot about Dins and became talked about only in legends and myths.
