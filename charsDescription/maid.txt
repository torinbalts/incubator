	-Backstory:
		Born into a farmer family, with 2 brother, she saw her family
                burn in a half conscious state when out of carelessness, her
                brothers made the gas in their house expload while she was
                watering the flowers outside. She got caught in the explosion
                and still has some scars from it. She was 8year old at this time.

                After that, she got adopted by her aunt. Her aunt was working on
                a pyramid scheme, selling beauty products. She was great at
                keeping appearences. At home with the family she is devil:
                uncaring, slave master, arrogant and selfish. The uncle was no
                better working as a drug dealer while receiving pensions from
                his early retirement from a diagnosed psychological disorder.

                Angela's life was a living hell. Had to do mostly all chores,
                got bullied by her brothers, her pleas ignored by her
                adoptive parents and the scapegoat for all family. The only time
                she could relax was at school. She did not have friends there
                but the bullying was almost none except for the teasing of her
                brothers that also attended the same school. The place she loved
                in the school was the library. During breaks, she would go
                there, sit in the sopha chair and pick a book and let the mind wonder
                in the fantasy adventures of it. She would come back to reality
                when she heard the bell. The librarians were quite kind to her
                and as she became a regular, they would try to start up a
                conversation with her hardly with much feedback.

                The last thing her brothers ever did to her was shave her hair
                in public while her aunt already left the scene as if not
                knowing them. They were living in the city so many people was
                seeing the scene. Lots of people rushed to stop them and the
                girl was in her knees in tears unable to look up in shame. The
                boys got an earful from the people around and, as taught by
                their mother, they said the were street bumbs. From the side, a
                famous book writer was hearing everything. He now approached the
                12 year old girl and asked her if she really had no parents
                girl who was now 12 year old
